# ESL Game Guide
You're new best friend is the [The ULTIMATE Warface ESL Guide](https://www.warface.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=20644). This will take you through all the necessary steps to get ready to play in a ESL tournament match.

## System requirements
EasyAnticheat (the software built into Warface) is picky about Windows being up to date. ESL Wire is even more picky. Note that Windows 7 may not work at all since it is not a mainstream supported operating system (by **Microsoft!**, not just ESL). With Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, make sure all updates are installed.

**READ THE ENTIRE GUIDE** Even the parts which you don't need to specifically follow.

You need to follow the instructions under these headings:

- How to add/change a gameaccount (Warface Nickname)
- How to join a Cup and how to use the matching platform
- Where can I find the cup and the rules?
- How to join a cup
- How to start and play a match, submit all the required matchmedia and enter the final score.
- How to check you Wire Logfiles (aka your Wire connection status when playing a cup).
- How to ask the admins a question or open a match-related protest
- How to install ESL Wire
- How to use ESL Wire with Warface
- How to test ESL Wire with Warface before a cup

For #10, [I've made a short instructional video for you on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laNMMhkKfWo&feature=youtu.be).

Please **carefully** follow all instructions, and if something does work, check if there is a note in the guide.
> ESL Wire must properly send all the data without crashing
>
> If ANY issues (freezes, crashes, disconnects, game kicks - hopefully not bans -, etc.) come up during the course of this test, hurrah! You potentially saved the day for you and the rest too. Make sure you take a little extra time reporting the issue to ESL support (coming up now.)

# Game Day (But read it now!)
There are some steps which you won't be able to follow until game day. Please carefully read and commit as much as possible of these steps to memory. On game day, keep the guide open in a tab (and the gamepage open in another!).

Information about the tournament can be found on the tournament page. You can find links to current tournaments on the [ESL Warface NA page](https://play.eslgaming.com/warface/north-america/). From there you can get dates, times, and the bracket once teams are checked in. From the bracket, you can individual match pages, which give you specific info about who you are playing and details of the game.

# Questions
If you have questions about the process, first read [The ULTIMATE Warface ESL Guide](https://www.warface.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=20644) **again** to see if it's covered there. Then try asking bluesaberist. If you are having errors or problems with ESL Wire, thuroughly search for your problem in the ESL Warface Guide, ESL website support, Google, and finally try contacting ESL support.
