# LETHAL ASSASSINS

LA is a serious clan with serious players. We are working toward being sponsored and recognized as a top clan within Warface and eventual other games.

To achieve this goal, all members must fit these criteria:

- Be very active!
 - Players need to be playing Warface on a daily or near-daily basis. We understand that life sometimes gets in the way, and we can extend leniency when something stops you from playing.
 - If you know that you won’t be able to play for more than a few days, please leave a message in the LA Discord chat notifying the officers in the clan. Being MIA is bad.
- Be in voice chat!
 - Players are required to use voice chat for ALL clan wars. Our primary provider is Discord, but other voice chat services are not shunned if your party is ENTIRELY in agreement to use them.
- Participate in clan wars!
 - Player must pay attention to clan chat notifications to join clan wars. If the words "mandatory" or “required” are used, you must join voice chat.
 - If you are unable to use voice chat at a particular time, you must communicate that to a ranking officer.
- Sign up with ESL.
 - Members of LA need to create and keep an ESL account in good standing.

All members are required to be courteous and respectful at all times while representing the clan. We have some specific rules that must be followed:

- Absolutely no hacking, EVER.
- Members may NEVER trash talk, taunt, call hacks, disparage, or complain about the other team AT ALL in public chat during clan wars and clan related activities. Please keep complaints within voice chat and team chat to a minimum. We all know there are unscrupulous players and teams out there, and sometimes we intentionally face these players and teams.

## Officers and Clan Ranks

Warface provides a very simple system for ranking within a clan. There is a clan master, who can invite, kick, and promote members. There are officers, who can invite players, and there is everyone else.

LA needs slightly more organization than this to maintain order. We have split officers into Top Commanders, Recruiters, and Officers. We have also split everyone else informally into Fighters and Recruits. All positions inherit the privileges of those below it.

### Who are our officers?

Our Clan Master is Shaolinman. If you disrespect or ignore Shao, expect to see major consequences.

Currently our Top Commanders and Recruiters are the same subset of officers. Either of these two positions make you a Ranking Officer. These players are (alphabetically):
- bluesaberist
- EckoRED
- EvanDarcy88
- goose64
- \_PSYCH0

Our Officers are the remaining player who rank 12 and up by clan points. This position is a badge of honor for their effort and dedication.

Fighter are all players who have been in the clan for more than 2 weeks.

Recruits are our newest players.

### What do these ranks mean?

Our **Clan Master** has all possible privileges and rights.

**Top Commanders** are players who have shown strong leadership, ability, and dedication. These members are in charge of organizing and maintaining squads within the clan.

**Recruiters **are Officers who have the responsibility to bring new members into the clan.

**Officers **is an honor rank. Officers are to be respected above Fighters.

**Fighters **are our active clan members.

**Recruits **are new players who are being mentored into the clan by Recruiters. These members are expected to sometimes have questions, and Recruits will get some extra leniency from our officers, in some facets of clan activity. At the same time, Recruits will have little leniency for being in-active.

## Squads

LA is working toward building squads within the clan for the sake of organization and grouping players who work well together, as well as for building strong teams for competing in ESL and beyond.

At the moment, there is one squad, **Alpha**, which is being specifically constructed to be a very dedicated group, led by bluesaberist. Alpha squad members will focus on playing with other Alpha squad members to build teamwork. This means that if there are only two or three Alpha members on, they may run clan wars which they will not invite or allow other clan members into. 

After Alpha squad has settled somewhat, other squads will start to be formed, to be led by EckoRED, EvanDarcy88, goose64 and shaolinman, and \_PSYCH0.

If you feel you work well with another player, please tell a Top Commander so that we have that information to work with in the future.

## Contacting Members and Officers

If you need to contact a member, please first attempt to talk to them via voice if they are in a chat. If that fails, then you may @mention the user in General chat if public chat is reasonable, otherwise you may send a direct message using Discord.

If you find that you are server-muted in Discord, and don’t know why, please contact an online Ranking Officer.

## Joining the Clan

To join the clan, please contact one of our Recruiters. If none are online, fall back to any Officer, but please understand that they are not allowed to immediately invite you to the clan. If we do not know your playing ability, we will most likely organize a practice match which you will be invited to.

Once invited into the clan, the Recruiter who invited you will be making sure that you are actively participating in clan wars. If your activity falls short, expect to be kicked from the clan. Please don’t take this as an insult. If something happened during your first two weeks and you were kicked, you may try to re-join the clan later.
