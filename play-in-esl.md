# Play in ESL!
Your primary resource for playing Warface ESL games is the [The ULTIMATE Warface ESL Guide](https://www.warface.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=20644). This walks you through all the steps necessary to get going. You are required to read this guide, and follow the relavent parts. To that extent, I've built a small [players guide to the Warface ESL guide](https://github.com/bluesaberist/lethal-assassins-rules-guides/blob/master/esl-guide.md).

If you've followed those instructions before, already ran a test cup with ESL Wire, or already played in an ESL tournament, great! Read it again to refresh. If you have not completed the instructions prior, or don't know what I'm talking about, **read the guide and follow all instructions.**

# Joining LETHAL ASSASSINS ESL Team(s)
I post the link to join the primary LA team in `#esl-tournament` chat once in a while. If you can't find it, you can always PM me and I'll re-send it. This team is the center point for ESL activities, and includes all LA members. Since tournaments require 5-9 players per team, we create sub-teams off of LA to participate. Once check-in for the tournament nears, the sub-team leader will give the accepted players invitations to their team.

# Participation requirements
To get enrolled as a LETHAL ASSASSINS ESL player, you need to meet certain goals:
- Have successfully run an ESL Test Cup with your current PC system, OR, have successfully competed in a prior tournament with your current system.
- Know the tournament date and time. You can find this out a couple way:
 - Look for my #esl-tournament message which includes the date and time.
 - Visit the [ESL Warface NA page](https://play.eslgaming.com/warface/north-america/), and click on an upcoming tournament.
- Have been playing at least somewhat actively.
 - Being low activity doesn't disclude you as a player, but it will likely put you in the backup players list.
- Talks in voice chat.
 - Sorry to our LETHAL ASSASSINS members who don't talk, but that does drop you out of the running. Communication is vital to working together as a team.

# Game streaming and recording
If you have a computer capable of recording while playing without losing performance, then it is valuable to do so for the tournaments. If nothing else, this lets those who didn't get to participate in on the action. However, there are some extra restrictions necessary in the voice and text chat to make this possible.

# Voice and text chat rules during ESL play
- Do not call hacks\*, disparage, make rude, racists, or otherwise offensive comments in **any** voice or text chat during ESL play.
- Try not to be rowdy, we want the viewing experience to be pleasant if possible.
- Please remember not to use any real names or reveal personal information about other players.
- You **may** give a short plug to your own YouTube, Twitch, or similar channels between games, **if** those channels are relevent (gaming channel with games including Warface, ok! Personal channel which has a couple game videos and lots of random stuff - not ok!)

## \*calling hacks
Calling hacks includes literally complaining that a player is hacking, but also implying that they are, and frequent complaining about tanking, lag, teleporting (lag), or other interactions which you don't think are reasonable. Whether or not they appeared so, they did happen, and the player will get caught by ESL afterword if they were actually cheating.
